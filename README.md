# QRwarning

A simple project to provide resources for warning folks about clicking QR codes.  We'll use GitHub Pages to host a landing page with warnings, guidance, advice.  We'll create a QR code pointing to the GutHub Pages URL.  We can use the QR code as print and digital media to dupe folks into visitng the GitHub Page.
